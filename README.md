## Hi, I'm Rexon32 👋

I'm a beginner Python developer with a strong interest in IT system integration and cybersecurity.

Currently, I focus on:
- Learning Python through small practical projects
- Working with Git and GitHub
- Understanding IT security basics (e.g. PGP, handling sensitive data)
- Learning how systems, networks and logs work

I enjoy learning by building simple tools and documenting my progress here on GitHub.

### Technologies & Tools
- Python (beginner, scripting)
- Git & GitHub
- Windows
- Basic IT security concepts

### Goals
- Improve my Python skills step by step
- Gain practical experience in IT and system integration
- Prepare for an apprenticeship in IT
